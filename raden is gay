  <h3>How the "Try It Yourself" Feature Works (Summary)</h3>
  <p>The "Try It Yourself" editors let you write and run your own code directly on this page.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTML Editor:</strong> When you press "Run," your HTML code is displayed live below using the browser’s iframe feature, which shows exactly how your webpage will look.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript Editor:</strong> When running JavaScript code, all <code>console.log</code> outputs are captured by a custom console and displayed below the editor, so you can see results and error messages immediately.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This setup lets you experiment and learn by doing — no external tools or websites are needed!</p>
